          Enabling this option will make the bot ask users a security question
          to confirm their identity upon them joining the Discord server. The
          security question could be any uniquely identfying information you
          have on each student to verify it's them. Make sure to place the
          answers to the security question you choose in the 6th column of your
          initial CSV file. By default, the question is set to "What is your
          middle name?", but this can easily be changed in the code.

                It is assumed that the first six columns of the CSV file will
                contain the students First Name, Last Name, UP Number, Level,
                Course Name, and Security Question Answer (like Middle Names)
                respectively. I did not have access to the real UoP CSV file so
                assumptions had to be made for this project.

                It is assumed that the first and second columns of the CSV file
                will contain the students UP numbers and the students progress
                decisions respectively. I did not have access to the real UoP
