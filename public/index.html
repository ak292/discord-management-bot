          Enabling this option will make the bot ask users a security question
          to confirm their identity upon them joining the Discord server. The
          security question could be something like "What is your middle name?"

            It is assumed that the first and second columns of the CSV file will
            contain the students UP numbers and the students progress decisions
            respectively. I did not have access to the real UoP CSV file so
            assumptions had to be made for this project.
