| Function            |               Argument(s)                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| changeCSVValues     | One argument - an array of 5 OR 6 values | The purpose of this function is to allow the client to customize their CSV file column numbers any way they want. If the client has the first name of students as the 1st column in their CSV file, they would input 1 for that value, and so on, and these values will be taken as an argument by this function and the "csvValues" object will be changed accordingly. This function receives an array of 5 or 6 values which will be received from the client-side. When the client submits their values, a POST request is made to a specific endpoint called "csvCustomizer" setup in the server, which will then invoke this function. This function takes the array of values and uses it to change the values of an object called "csvValues". The bot then uses the csvValues later on in the code when verifying the user/student.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| changeAbbreviations |   One argument - an array of 9 values    | The purpose of this function is to allow the client to customize any abbreviations they may or may not be using in their CSV file "course name" column. For example, the clients CSV file may choose to use "CS" as an abbreviation for "Computer Science", and this function allows the client to input those abbreviations so the bot can be made aware of it. This function receives an array of 9 values which will be received from the client-side. When the client submits their values, a POST request is made to a specific endpoint called "abbreviations" setup in the server, which will then invoke this function. When this function is invoked, a boolean variable called "abbreviationsMode" will be set to true, indicating that the bot now needs to handle abbreviations when dealing with the CSV file provided by the client. The array of values provided as an argument is then taken and used to change the values of each abbreviation stored in an object called "abbreviations" accordingly based on the clients input. |
changeCustomSecurityQuestion | One argument - a variable containing the text of the security question | This function takes the argument containing the security question input by the client and sets the value of a variable called "customSecurityQuestion" to the security question provided as an argument. The bot will then use this security question later on in the code if needed. |
changeInitialCSV | Zero arguments | This function changes a boolean variable called "initialCSV" from false to true. This function is only invoked when the client inputs a CSV file containing verification information to verify new users/students. If the client has not input any CSV file, the "initialCSV" boolean will remain false and the bot will not attempt to verify any students until the boolean value is true. |
clearOutResults | Zero arguments | This function clears out the results array which contains the contents of the verification CSV file input by the client. This function is only invoked when the client inputs another verification CSV file after already inputting an initial one, so the results array must be cleared. |
clearOutProgressResults | Zero arguments | This function clears out the progress results array which contains the contents of the progress decisions CSV file input by the client. This function is only invoked when the client inputs another progress decisions CSV file after already inputting an initial one, so the progress results array must be cleared. |
